				<p><em>This does seem the apropriate choice for us, easy day to day running but any more needs a developer.</em></p>

				<p>This is the new kid on the block, for NodeJS it's the only real choice for a CMS (unless you want to build your own with Sails)</p>

				<p>Being based on Node it will run faster than apache. <br />
				There's not much support but it is similar to sails so it's not entirley unfamiliar - the geek choice for a complex site!</p>

				<p>To update content - anyone could do it, to edit structure is more in depth but probably a lot more flexible than the other solutions, plus we're already used to sails and this is like a close relative</p>
