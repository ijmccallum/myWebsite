I have built websites, developed video games, and created media for almost every form of digital design there is.  I also believe in simplicity.  Not just in it being the ultimate sophistication, but in it being a necessity for a happy life – which is my biggest aim!  And I have a sneaking suspicion we may have that aim in common.  So drop me a line, I’d love to chat.</p>
