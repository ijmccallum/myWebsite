            For smaller sites I use the fantastic, and open source CMS, WordPress.  
            This allows me to set up sites very quickely and extend them to do almost anything you can imagine.  
            It is also a wonderfully simple system that lets you manage your content and even edit the structure of your site!<br />
            <br />
            For larger, more complex sites I work with various Node.JS modules to create a system which, given enough time and resources, is virtually limetless.

        <p><strong>Wikilogic</strong> is a crowd-sourced logic mapping project.  It is a massive undertaking which, if successfull, has tremendous potential to benefit a huge number of people.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest dreams from the group behind Sophie's Games has been Wikilogic. For so long it remained a loose concept, but after developing Synergy and honing our various professional skill sets, we finally found ourselves in the right position to start realising this idea. In short: it intends to do for logic what Wikipedia is doing for knowledge.</p> 
        <p>Rather than explain any further here, I would strongly encourage you to have a look at the foundation's site and, if you can, please consider getting involved too - we could use all the help we can get!</p>
        <p>The project: <code><a href="http://www.wikilogicfoundation.org/" target="_blank">www.WikiLogicFoundation.org</a></code></p>

        <p><strong>Sencha Insights</strong> is a tech blog focusing on Sencha and related web technologies.  I built this site on Node.JS using the still-in-development Keystone.js CMS.  As these technologies are still fairly new the choice of templates is limited / non-existant.  I took a theme without any back end and threaded it into Keystone to create a site which is effectivly a very fancy blog.  It has it's own browser plugin which allows interesting articles to be saved whenever they pop up and it publishes it's newsletter automatically every two weeks.  This site practically runs it's self!</p>

            My interest in code was sparked while working on the art and design for <a href="http://iainjmccallum.com/synergy.php">Synergy</a>, 
            and I couldn't be more glad that it happened!  I learnt by working through the whole of Stanford's online 'Programming methodology' cource and getting stuck into development for WordPress themes and plugins using simple HTML, CSS and PHP.  
            Web Design and Development became a part of my freelance work which led to my first job as a Designer/Developer with a Software Development company where I picked up a far more in-depth understanding of development and the many tools that go with it.
        	From then until now I have built and helped out with a number of projects, the list above shows some of the more interesting ones.
