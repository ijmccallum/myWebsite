            My interest in code was sparked while working on the art and design for <a href="http://iainjmccallum.com/synergy.php">Synergy</a>, 
            and I couldn't be more glad that it happened!  I learnt by working through the whole of Stanford's online 'Programming methodology' cource and getting stuck into development for WordPress themes and plugins using simple HTML, CSS and PHP.  
            Web Design and Development became a part of my freelance work which led to my first job as a Designer/Developer with a Software Development company where I picked up a far more in-depth understanding of development and the many tools that go with it.
        	From then until now I have built and helped out with a number of projects, below are some of the more interesting ones.

	<p><strong>Wikilogic</strong> is a crowd-sourced logic mapping project.  It is a massive undertaking which, if successfull, has tremendous potential to benefit a huge number of people.

To find out more about the project, what it is, and how to get involved yourself - have a look at the home page:</p>

	<p><strong>Sophie's Games</strong> is the group behind <a href="http://iainjmccallum.com/synergy.php">Synergy</a>.  We were brought together by a common interest in using games to create a positive impact or inspire thought on important issues.  The website is ment as a simple, clean area that describes us and points to our games without any extra fuss.</p>

    <p><strong>Christina D Gonzalez</strong> is a Landscape Architect for whome I put together this simple WordPress theme.  As it was one of the earliest website projects I worked on, this theme was built from scratch.</p>

    <p><strong>Fuel Jack</strong> is a location, fuel, and theft tracking product aimed at companies with large vehicle fleets.  This brochure site was designed and built from scratch to give them a place to refrence potentially interested customers.</p>

    <p><strong>Sencha Insights</strong> is a tech blog focusing on Sencha and related web technologies.  I built this site on Node.JS using the still-in-development Keystone.js CMS.  As these technologies are still fairly new the choice of templates is limited / non-existant.  I took a theme without any back end and threaded it into Keystone to create a site which is effectivly a very fancy blog.</p>

    <p><strong>Wedding site</strong>, a simple, minimal, statment of design.  As this is our own I was able to create it explicitly to my own taste and desire for simplicity.</p>
