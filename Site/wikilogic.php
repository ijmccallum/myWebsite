        	One of the biggest dreams from the group behind Sophie's Games has been Wikilogic.  For so long it remained a loose concept, 
        	but after developing Synergy and honing our various professional skill sets, we finally found ourselves 
        	in the right position to start realising this idea.  In short: it intends to do for logic what Wikipedia is doing for knowledge.
        	Rather than explain any further here, I would strongly encourage you to have a look at the foundation's site and, if you can, please
        	consider getting involved too - we could use all the help we can get!
