        <strong>Summary:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Education is meant to bring in the future, but the system is stuck in the past and has placed an over inflated importance on academia.</li>
            <li>There are more educated people now than in the whole of history, this has created academic inflation: degrees arn't worth what they once were.</li>
            <li>Every education system in the world has the same hierarchy. 1: Mathematics & languages, 2:humanities, 3: The Arts. This worked in the industrial revolution, now it is profoundly wrong.</li>
            <li><strong>Creativity in education is as important as literacy.</strong> (creativity being the ability to have original ideas that have value).</li>
            <li>If you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original. Children don't have a fear of being wrong, it is educated into them and turned into a stigma.</li>
            <li>Intelligence is diverse (visual, audiable, kinesthetic), it is interactive, it is creative.</li>

        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>For good teamwork in any organisation, the individuals must feel safe.  If they fear the loss of their jobs due to bad preformance, the effectivness of the team will decrease.</li>
                <li>Saftey is defined by the attitude of the organisations leader.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>"Leadership is a chioce, it is not a rank.  
                I know many people at the senior most levels of organisations who are absolutly not leaders.
                They are authorities, and we do what they say because they have authority over us, but we would not follow them.
                And I know many people who are at the bottoms of organisations who have no authority and they are absolutly leaders.
                And this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them
                and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them.
                This is what a leader is.

            <li>How do some people defy the odds: Apple, Martin Luther King, the Wright brothers... They think, act and communicate in the exact opposit to everyone else.</li>
            <li>What | Every organisation knows what they do.<br />
                How  | Some know how (USP, differenting value proposition, proprietary process)<br />
                Why  | Very few know why they do what they do. (not to make a profit, that's a result - it means purpose, cause, belief)
            </li>
            <li>Most go from what to why, the inspired ones go from why to what.</li>
            <li>People don't buy what you do they buy why you do it.</li>

            <li>The goal is not to do business with people who want what you have, it's to do business with the people who believe what you believe</li>
            <li>If you hire people because they have the skills they'll work for your money.  If you hire people who believe what you believe, they'll give you their blood sweat and tears.</li>
            <li>The law of diffusion of innovation, bell curve describing innovators(1st 2.5% of population), early adopters (13.5%), early majority (34%), late majority (34%), laggards (16%)<br />
                If you want mass market success / acceptance of an idea, you can't have it until achieving the tipping point at 15 - 18% market penetration.  These are the people who buy with their hearts - the Why.</li>
                <li>What you do simply proves what you believe. People will do what proves what they believe.</li>

            <li>We are often told everyone is equal yet there are deep inequalities, this causes envy.</li>

<p>Stumbled upon this from i09:
    <blockquote>On Twitter, Pixar storyboard artist Emma Coats has compiled nuggets of narrative wisdom she's received working for the animation studio over the years. </blockquote>
<pre>
#1: You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.

#2: You gotta keep in mind what's interesting to you as an audience, not what's fun to do as a writer. They can be v. different.

#3: Trying for theme is important, but you won't see what the story is actually about til you're at the end of it. Now rewrite.

#4: Once upon a time there was ___. Every day, ___. One day ___. Because of that, ___. Because of that, ___. Until finally ___.

#5: Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You'll feel like you're losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.

#6: What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?

#7: Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.

#8: Finish your story, let go even if it's not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time.

#9: When you're stuck, make a list of what WOULDN'T happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up.

#10: Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you've got to recognize it before you can use it.

#11: Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you'll never share it with anyone.

#12: Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind. And the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th – get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself.

#13: Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it's poison to the audience.

#14: Why must you tell THIS story? What's the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That's the heart of it.

#15: If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.

#16: What are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. What happens if they don't succeed? Stack the odds against.

#17: No work is ever wasted. If it's not working, let go and move on - it'll come back around to be useful later.

#18: You have to know yourself: the difference between doing your best and fussing. Story is testing, not refining.

#19: Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.

#20: Exercise: take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How d'you rearrange them into what you DO like?

#21: You gotta identify with your situation/characters, can't just write ‘cool'. What would make YOU act that way?

#22: What's the essence of your story? Most economical telling of it? If you know that, you can build out from there.
