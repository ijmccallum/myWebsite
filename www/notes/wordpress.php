<p><em>The default for small projects that will be handed over to a customer.</em></p>

<p>We know it, a simple, easy to use blogging solution, not as powerful as Drupal or Joomla but so many extensions!  Limited design flexibility.  Good at multiple users</p>


<hr />
<p>WordPress as an operating system for the web</p>

<p>I would like to see a few things / code a few plugins / find out if they already exist somewhere:
<ul>
	<li>A better code editor</li>
	<li>A file system explorer for the server</li>
	<li>A terminal</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>For me to do to mine:
<ul>
	<li>My dashboard my home</li>
</ul>
