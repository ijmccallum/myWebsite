<p>These are likley to stay grey as I've decided to focus on pure Web App development. 
	This is because I don't really see many, if any, huge advantages to apps being native 
	or given acces to some native capabilities.  For those advantages that do exist, I beileve 
	it is only a matter of time before Web Apps catch up.  This isn't to say I'll never go down this path again -
	it's hard to know what the future holds!</p>
