				<h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-file"></span> Universal Analytics for the Front End.</h4>
				<p>Turns out I really enjoy learning subjects by writing chunky articles about them!  So Delphic is now a Google Analytics Certified
				Partner (well done!) and even though I'm part of the team there now I don't actually know much about this subject.  Time for another
				big research stint - this time I've rewritten and reorganized the docs so they make more sense to me, enjoy!</p>

				<h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-file"></span> Sass Architecture.</h4>
				<p>After starting at Delphic I was introduced to their boilerplate front-end.  It uses the 7-1 idea for organizing the sass sheets
				which really intreguied me, up until this point I hadn't come accross any 'official' ways of organizing it all so I got stuck into 
				researching the subject and also wrote up a bunch of Sass tips and tricks I've picked up along the way.</p>

				<p>I've been using Git for a while, mainly for personal work.  But with all the projects at Delphic moving from SVN to Git I had some 
				official motivation to dive in and go through everything more thoroughly.  That was the impetus for writing this article/cheat sheet -
				to clarify everything in my mind and share those clarifications so that someone somewhere might benefit from it.</p>
