        <p><strong>Wikilogic</strong> is an open source project currently being developed and looked after by myself and a few others.  
            The idea is to create a system that will allow us to map out all logic, or as much of it as we can fit into a sharded database.  
            This might seem a little wild but at a holistic level, it's actually quite simple.<br /><br />  We have a live demo running which I can supply a link to on request,
            or you can get it running locally by visiting the <a href="https://github.com/WikiLogic/WikiLogic">Github</a> page.  We'll be writing about more general progress
            on the <a href="http://www.wikilogicfoundation.org/" target="_blank">main site</a> and the in depth theory is being laid out in our <a href="http://www.wikilogicfoundation.org/wiki">meta wiki</a>.

        <p><strong>UK and National Wedding Shows</strong>, funnily enough I was working on these during the preparation for my own wedding!
            I worked remotely with a team coordinated by <a href="http://www.tagdigital.co.uk/">Tag Digital</a> to produce these twin sites.
            They run on WordPress with a heavily adapted version of <a href="http://theme.co/x/">x</a>, a multi-theme theme which, in my humble opinion, 
            is more hassle than it's worth.

        <p><strong>Bubbles!</strong> was an experiment in app development for Android.  It was only meant to be a test to run through the process of creating and publishing
            but it turned into a full game written with <code>Create.js</code> and wrapped with <code>Cordova</code>.  As a result of this being a small test that just kept growing, 
            it's all written in one gigantic javascript file!  Taught me a thing or two about what not to do.  Still, got it working, pretty proud of that!<br />  
            <br />
            You can now download it onto any android device or just play it in the browser.

        <p><strong>Sencha Insights</strong> is a tech blog focusing on Sencha and related web technologies.  I built this site on Node.JS using the still-in-development Keystone.js CMS.  As these technologies are still fairly new the choice of templates is limited / non-existant.  I took a theme without any back end and threaded it into Keystone to create a site which is effectivly a very fancy blog.  It has it's own browser plugin which allows interesting articles to be saved whenever they pop up and it publishes it's newsletter automatically every two weeks.  This site practically runs it's self!</p>

            My interest in code was sparked while working on the art and design for <a href="http://iainjmccallum.com/synergy.php">Synergy</a>, 
            and I couldn't be more glad that it happened!  I learnt by working through the whole of Stanford's online 'Programming methodology' cource and getting stuck into development for WordPress themes and plugins using simple HTML, CSS and PHP.  
            Web Design and Development became a part of my freelance work which led to my first job as a Designer/Developer with a Software Development company where I picked up a far more in-depth understanding of development and the many tools that go with it.
        	From then until now I have built and helped out with a number of projects, the list above shows some of the more interesting ones.
