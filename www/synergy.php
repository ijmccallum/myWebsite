        	After University I became involved with a small group looking to start making ‘Thought provoking games’, in other words: 
        	games that could convey a message and get people to start thinking more about important issues facing society.  We called ourselves 
        	Sophie’s Games (philosophy) and started working on Synergy.  Being our first real game production this was quite a challenge but we 
        	kept at it over the evenings and weekends, juggling work, life and this production.  Finally, after a long while of learning, developing 
        	and refining, we finished!  You can see the art, hear the music and play the game over on the website I put together for the group at 
        	<a href="http://sophiesgames.com/">sophiesgames.com</a>
        </p>

        	Or, if you just want to see what the game looks and sounds like, there is always the play through video below,<br />
        	but don’t watch all of it!  It’ll spoil the puzzles for you!
